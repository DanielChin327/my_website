    <h3 class=article-title>What is Tea? What is Coffee?</h3>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Tea and coffee, two of the world's most popular beverages, have rich histories that have significantly impacted cultures and economies globally. Tea's journey began in ancient China, where it was first consumed for its medicinal properties around 2737 BC. Legend has it that Emperor Shen Nong discovered tea when leaves from a wild tree blew into his pot of boiling water. By the Tang Dynasty (618â€“907 AD), tea drinking had become a daily ritual in Chinese society and spread to neighboring countries like Japan and Korea, deeply influencing their social customs and cultural ceremonies, such as the Japanese tea ceremony.</p>

      <p>Coffee's origins trace back to the Ethiopian plateau, where, according to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi discovered the beans' stimulating effects in the 9th century. By the 15th century, coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Yemen. Coffeehouses, known as qahveh khaneh, became cultural hubs in the Middle East, offering a place for socialization, political discourse, and intellectual exchange. As coffee spread to Europe in the 17th century, it sparked a wave of innovation and productivity, with coffeehouses becoming centers for artistic and scientific discussion, famously contributing to the Age of Enlightenment.</p>

      <p>The global consumption of tea and coffee has left an indelible mark on economies and societies. The British East India Company played a pivotal role in the tea trade, making tea a staple in Britain and its colonies, which led to significant historical events such as the Boston Tea Party and the Opium Wars. Coffee's spread to the New World resulted in the establishment of vast coffee plantations in South America, transforming economies in countries like Brazil and Colombia. Today, both beverages are integral to daily life across the globe, symbolizing hospitality, tradition, and modernity. Their consumption continues to shape global trade, culture, and social dynamics, illustrating their enduring legacy.</p>
